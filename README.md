Apple fonts not readily available for public download.

The main Apple fonts are hosted at https://developer.apple.com/fonts/ but two important ones, Apple Color Emoji and Apple Symbols, aren't available for download anywhere that I've found and the only way to get them is from the fonts folder of macOS.

Versions:
- Apple Color Emoji - probably 18.0d4e1 (2023)
- Apple Symbols - 12.0d3e10 (2016)

The emoji font file is large so instead of actually committing any font files to the repo I've opted to just stick everything into Releases.
